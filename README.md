# Shin Pokémon Red and Blue

Version 1.19.2 development

This is a rom hack of pokemon red & blue based on the Pret team's disassembly.  
It's a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game.  
Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life improvements have been added.  
Think of it as what the Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of red & blue might have been (plus a few extra goodies).  

Don't like the non-vanilla changes? Prefer only the bugfixes and AI improvements? Want a codebase from which to launch your own rom hack?
Then the [Lite branch](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/tree/lite) is what you want. Head on over and start compiling.


Download the IPS patch file of the version you want and apply it to its respective USA rom.  
Always apply patches to a fresh USA ROM or else strange glitches will occur.  

***Now includes Pokemon Green!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to what green version had.
- Apply the ips patch to a USA Blue rom.

Important Note: If you are using a save file from a previous version, you might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Palette Town.

Notice: New patches might crash upon loading a save from a previous patch.
		To prevent this from happening, save outside in Pallet Town.

#Summary
-----------

***Lite features for a cleaned-up purist experience***

A huge number of bugs, glitches, oversights, and text errors of all sorts have been fixed. 
There are too many to enumerate in a simple summary, and some of them are very obscure or previously undiscovered.

Includes an english Green version. 
It swaps the graphics, Cerulean Cave layout, and a few lines of text to replicate the original Green version.
Apply the patch to a USA blue rom to use it.

Engine features from USA Yellow version have been backported.
Super Gameboy palettes get converted to display on the Gameboy Color. No more monochrome!
The audio engine is backported. Hit SELECT on the options screen to cycle through the output types.

Trainer AI has been improved and greatly expanded. 
Some trainers will even try to switch pokemon intelligently.

You get notified when a box is filled (either via catching or depositing a pokemon).

Switching out of a trapping move wastes the trapper's turn. 
This prevents unbeatable AI scenarios as well as a PP underflow glitch.

Rage is limited to 2-3 turns but attack boosts are kept.
This is primarily to prevent infinite battle loops.

Sleep does not prevent choosing a move, and the move is used upon waking up.
To maintain sleep move accuracy, sleep starts with a counter of at least 2.
And Rest now sets the sleep counter to 3.   
   
   
***Additional Master features that go beyond engine modifications and fixes***

An experimental New Game+ has been added.

All 151 pkmn are available in one version.

You can play as a boy or a girl.

There's an EXP bar in battle.

You can hunt for shiny pokemon, and they are valid with Gen 2 games.

No more grinding wild pokemon. Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them once or twice.

The "SET" battle style gives increased difficulty by making the stats of trainer pokemon more on your level.
It also doubles the effect of X-stat items that trainers love to use.

One of OAK's aides toggles scaling of trainer rosters to your level (evolving them if applicable).

Another of OAK's aides toggles a pokeball-caught symbol in battle after obtaining the pokedex.
To aide with to Gen 2 interaction, this also applies a gender symbol to species that can be male or female.

Lots of quick-keys features.
- Place the cursor over FIGHT and press Select to play the enemy 'mon cry if it's already owned.
- Softlock Warp - instantly teleport back to your mom's house if you get stuck.
- Running Shoes - Hold B to double your speed when walking, surfing, and biking. Includes proper animation speed-up!
- Press SELECT to use HMs based on proper context.
- Press SELECT while holding A to automatically get on/off your bike or use the best rod in your inventory.
- Hold SELECT and enter the status screen to print a 'mons stat exp.
- Hold START and enter the status screen to print a 'mons DVs.
- When playing in color, hold SELECT when choosing a 'dex entry to load the shiny palette.
  
New NPCs!
- The move relearner and deleter are in Saffron City.
- An NPC in the Celadon Hotel will pay COINS for showing him pokemon as an alternative to slots.
- After the elite-4, a new vendor opens up in celadon allowing the purchase of normally unique items.
- After the elite-4, there is an NPC in the underground path that generates random trainer battles.
- The game corner chief will buy pokemon from the player post-e4.
- There's a tournament being held in the SS Anne's kitchen after the elite 4 are beaten. Yes, the ship returns!
- Added some special post-game trainer battles as fun little easter eggs. Can you find and defeat all five?

Other minor changes to lessen annoyance.
- TMs and HMs now have their attacks (albeit abbreviated) appended to the item names
- All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts.
- The safari zone mechanics run off level instead of speed and safari balls have a boosted catch rate.
- Slot machines are a little more lucky so now you can actually win big
- CUT is not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub).
- Yellow version learnsets have been integrated and stone evolutions gain back some level-up moves.
- Hitting with a trapping move reduces its user's speed by 25% until recalculated via some other effect.
- Trapping move users play their cry on the move's final turn.

Cheats and Secrets!
- A pokemon with Pay Day in your top slot will tip you off to a lucky slot machine and when it's in a special payout mode.
- New item, M.GENE, re-randomizes a pkmn's DVs to values of 9,8,8,8 or more.
- Defeat all five post-game special trainers to reactivate the legendary pokemon.
- To find shiny pokemon better, put a level-100 Chansey at the top of your roster. Use a repel if you wish!
- Do you dare to activate Missingno at the cinnabar shore? Only if you got your 'dex diploma.

  - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
  - Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
  - The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
  - For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
- Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings
- To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)

     - prevents things like spamming agility against poison pkmn
  - Enemy ai ignores super-effectiveness for moves that do static amounts of damage
  - Fixed skipping move-learn on level-up glitch. 
     - when gaining multiple levels at a time, each in-between level is incrementally checked for moves learned
     - this prevents a pkmn from skipping learnable moves if gaining multiple levels in battle
	 - also does this when evolving via level-up for the new evolution's movelist
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - The function that applies badge stat-ups now selectively boosts the correct stat when called during a stat-up/down effect
  - If player is frozen, the hyperbeam recharge bit is now cleared
     - now matches how enemy mon's recharge bit is cleared upon being frozen
     - this prevents getting stuck in a loop unable to do anything on your turn
  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves).
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
	 - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
     - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective
  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd

  - AI will not do actions during Rage or when recharging

	
- Move fixes
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters

  - Substitute fixes
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage moves (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc) can no longer critically hit
  - fixed-damage moves now obey type immunities
  - fixed-damage moves now ignore effectiveness text & sfx
  - Transform will no longer copy the opponent's Transform move. It's swapped-out for Struggle
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync

  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage

  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)

  
- Graphical Fixes
  - Glitched sprites can no longer cause a buffer overflow that corrupts the hall of fame

  - Fuschia gym plays the correct sfx when getting the TM from Koga
  - Vermilion gym plays the correct sfx when getting the TM from Surge
  - Restored sfx for getting a badge
    - A sfx is supposed to play when getting a badge, but not for all gym leaders and the sfx used is inconsistent
	- Looks like the idea was dropped in development due to issues with having separate audio banks
	- However, there is a unique unused sfx in the battle audio bank that signifies getting some kind of important item
	- This is likely what was going to be used for getting a badge at some point, and it has been restored

  - While inside victory road, boulders placed on switches will stay there between floor transitions
  - The formula functions for exp now have underflow protection.
  - General RNG improved to the one used by Prism and Polished Crystal (allows for all possible DVs naturally)

  - Moves that hit multiple times in a turn now calculate damage and critical hits for each individual attack
  - Trapping moves nerfed big time to prevent the new AI from cheesing them:
    - Switching out of a trapping move ends it immediately and wastes its user's turn (prevents PP underflow glitch too)
	- Each time a trapping move is used and hits, user's speed reduced 25% until recalculated through other mechanics
    - A pkmn plays its cry to signal the last turn of the trapping move

  - Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
    - The sleep counter's minimum value is increased by +1 to maintain accuracy of sleep moves

	-chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup

  - Defense, special, and speed DVs are between 8 and 15
  - HP DV is a minimum of 8 since attack DV is always odd-numbered

  - Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
  - Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level (only in "Set" style)
  - These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI

- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even swithing)
  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch
  
- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats
  - Pokemon have gained their TMs and Moves from yellow
  - Kadabra & Alakazam can access Kinesis via the move relearner
  - Raichu gains some attacks back via level
  - Arcanine gains some attacks back via level
  - Ninetails gains some attacks back via level
  - Poliwrath gains some attacks back via level
  - Cloyster gains some attacks back via level
  - Starmie gains some attacks back via level
  - Exeggcutor gains some attacks back via level
  - Vileplume gains some attacks back via level
  - Victreebel gains some attacks back via level
  - Clefable gains some attacks back via level
  - Wigglytuff gains some attacks back via level
  - Mewtwo can learn Swift by TM 
  - Kakuna and Metapod learn harden by level-up
  - pikachu and kadabra have their catch rates adjusted to yellow version
  - Give haunter/machoke/kadabra/graveler an evo by level option (level 45 to 48)
  - Butterfree and Beedrill have their prior evolutions' moves added to their level-0 move list
  - Clefable and Wigglytuff get some moves back via level-up
  - Diglett & Dugtrio can learn cut like in yellow version
  
- Engine changes just for developers
  - The trainer move engine has been backported from Yellow version; trainer movesets can now be fully customized
  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings

- A regular New Game will default the battle style to SET
- Yes/No prompt for flute use has been added to blocking snorlax
- Game corner prize costs re-balanced
- Slightly increased slot odds
- Slot machine coin counter runs twice as fast

- Bushes moved around so Erika can be battled without CUT
- The bush blocking the Vermilion gym has been replaced with a blocking pkmn that goes away after the ss anne leaves
- Gym leaders and elite 4 have their rosters, levels, & movesets slightly tweaked for gradual difficulty
- Blaine has a touched-up battle sprite so he doesn't look like an alien
  - Snagged this off reddit, but original artist unknown (let me know if this is yours)
- The elite 4 now use the gym battle music rather than the standard trainer music
- The juggler rosters, especially in fuchsia gym, have been slightly altered for flavor
- Just for fun, the last juggler in the fuchsia gym is replaced with a cameo of Janine
  - Though at this point she's still just a cooltrainer and doesn't have a unique battle sprite
