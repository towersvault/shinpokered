# Shin Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, Red-JP, & Blue-JP

Version 1.24.6

*Shin (真) - The kanji for "true".  
Used in Japanese media to denote a remastering, updated retelling , or a "true form" of something.*  

     This is an enhancement ROM hack of Pokemon Red & Blue based on the Pret team's pokered disassembly project.
It is a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game.
Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life enhancements have been added.
It also acts as a kind of research-informed speculative work that presents an alternate interpretation of the games.
Specifically, that being what the 2016 Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of Gen-1 Pokemon could have been.
     It is the image of a glitch-free experience with player-friendly goodies and enhancements common to other modern remasterings.  
The main purpose of the accompanying source code repository is to study, comment upon, and repair functional errors.
It is important to record, for posterity's sake, the methods used for restoring the game to an error-free state.
Finally, the source code documents many differences and changes between the various Japanese and English releases.

#Patch Info  
-----------
BPS patches are provided for entry into your preferred emulator, patching tool, or other accessory that supports the BPS format. 
Download and enter a patch which corresponds to the ROM of which you own a lawful copy.  
- **Red patches (Shin Pokemon Red, Red_origback, and Red-JP) are intended for USA Red.**
  - File/ROM SHA-1: EA9BCAE617FDF159B045185467AE58B2E4A48B9A
  - File/ROM CRC32: 9F7FDD53
- **All other patches (Blues and Greens) are intended for USA Blue.**
  - File/ROM SHA-1: D7037C83E1AE5B39BDE3C30787637BA1D4C48CE2
  - File/ROM CRC32: D6DA8A1A
- The "_origback" patches are alternatives that keep the original back sprites. 

Note: The BPS format looks for a matching SHA-1 or CRC32 ROM checksum such that it will not allow you to patch over an incorrect or corrupted ROM file. If you are having patching problems, verify your ROM file has the correct checksum using an online tool such as the one found at https://www.toolsley.com/crcmulti.html

***Includes Pokemon Green and Japanese Red!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to the original japanese release.
- Pokedex entries adapt the original Green version text that was translated in Fire Red.
- Pokedex uses metric units.

***Includes Japanese Blue!***
- Primarily builds the lists for encounters, trades, and prizes that were in the never-localized japanese release.
- Pokedex uses metric units.
- Other minor graphical adjustments.

***Updating Your Save File***
Deactivate all special options and NPC toggles in the old save if it's from an earlier patch.  
When loading an old save file with the latest patch, the player is automatically warped to Pallet Town.  
Normally this will be enough to update the save file without doing anything else.  
It's possible you may still have issues upon loading a save from a previous patch or an unpatched game.  
To prevent this from happening, save in the outdoor Pallet Town map on the old save.  
You might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.  
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.

Consecutive calls to the RNG function were performed in order to fill the memory with 8192 bytes of RNG data.  
These bytes were dumped and then then parsed into nybbles in order to simulate random DV values for pokemon.  
The following are histograms and statistical information on the various ways this project generates DVs.

#Summary
-----------

***Lite features for a cleaned-up purist experience***

Over 200 bugs, glitches, oversights, and text errors of all sorts have been fixed! 
There are too many to enumerate in a simple summary, and some of them are very obscure or previously undiscovered.

Includes english builds of Green and Red-JP versions. 
It swaps the graphics, Cerulean Cave layout, and a few lines of text to replicate the original japanese releases.
The original release pokedex entries have been adapted from the Fire Red translations.
It also has all the pokedex data in metric.

Includes an english build of Blue-JP version.
It swaps prizes, trades, wild encounter data, and some text to replicate the original japanese release.
It also has all the pokedex data in metric.

Engine features from USA Yellow version have been backported.
No more duochrome! Yellow's color scheme gets converted to display on the Gameboy Color.
Attack animations are colored according to type during Gameboy Color play.
Yellow's audio engine is backported for stereo sound support. 

New options that can be toggled! Hit SELECT on the options screen to see an extra options menu.
- Cycle through audio types.
- Playing in GBC mode on a backlit LCD screen?
  - Press SELECT at the copyright screen to activate color correction.
  - Or activate it in the extra menu
- Experimental 60FPS Mode
- Zero-Delay Text
- Hard Mode
- AI Trainer Switching

The hard mode option increases difficulty by making the stats of trainer pokemon more on your level.
It also doubles the effect of the X-stat items that AI trainers are fond of.
And it disallows the use of Revive items in battle.
Non-link battles will use the Stadium 1 critical hit chance formulas.
Finally, it makes catching a wild Mewtwo more challenging.

Trainer AI has been improved and greatly expanded.
Some trainers will even try to switch pokemon intelligently if you haven't disabled it in the extra options menu.

You get notified when a box is filled (either via catching or depositing a pokemon).

Switching out of a trapping move wastes the trapper's turn as per Pokemon Stadium.
This prevents unbeatable AI scenarios as well as a PP underflow glitch.

Rage is limited to 2-3 turns but attack boosts are kept.
This is primarily to prevent infinite battle loops.

Sleep does not prevent choosing a move, and the move is used upon waking up.
To maintain sleep move accuracy, sleep starts with a counter of at least 2.
And Rest now sets the sleep counter to 3.  
   
---  
***Additional Master features that go beyond engine modifications and fixes***

All 151 pkmn are available in one version including trade evolutions (rarities may vary per version).

You can play as a boy or a girl.

There's an EXP bar in battle.

You can hunt for shiny pokemon, and they are valid with Gen 2 games.

No more grinding wild pokemon. Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them once or twice.

You can choose RUN while holding SELECT in trainer battles to forfeit the match and black yourself out.

There is a built-in nuzlocke mode that can be toggled from the extra options menu.

The girl in Oak's lab toggles wild pokemon randomization.
If activated early enough in the game, your starter pokemon choices are randomized as well.

The AREA function of the PokeDex now takes the Super Rod into account.
It will also notify you if the Pokemon you are referencing is available in the immediate vicinity.
It even works with the randomizer active.

One of the aides in Oak's lab toggles scaling of trainer rosters to your level (evolving them if applicable).

As an alternative to trainer scaling, there is now an obedience level-cap that can be toggled in the extra options menu.
While active, the current maximum obedience level will display in the extra options menu.
All pokemon, not just trades, will start to disobey if over the displayed level cap.

The other aide in Oak's lab toggles a pokeball-caught symbol in battle after obtaining the pokedex.
To help with Gen 2 interaction, this also applies a gender symbol to species that can be male or female.

Another aide npc is in the Viridian pokemon center. He will toggle on/off randomization of non-special trainers.

An aide is in the Celadon Diner. He will toggle on/off a catch-up EXP boost function for under-leveled pokemon.

Item, Sleep, Freeze, Trapping, and Hyper Beam clauses can each be toggled by the Clause Brothers in Viridian City.
 
The bag now supports an additional item list for an extra 20 slots of space!
Press START on the bag menu to hot-swap the item list that populates the active bag.
The game's systems will generally detect items in the non-active bag space.
Unique systems, such as Pokemon Stadium, will only recognize the active bag's item list.

Hold SELECT and press START while on the bag menu or PC item box menu to auto-sort your items.

The itemfinder now points you in the right direction. 
You can always hold SELECT while choosing to USE it to get its original function back.

Each pokemon on your team has a field move slot.
These slots can temporarily hold a HM move for overworld-use only.
No longer do you have to sacrifice one of your four moves for a HM move.

An experimental New Game+ has been added.
It can be enabled if you have an uncorrupt save file wherein the Elite 4 have been beaten.
Press and hold SELECT while choosing New Game; a jingle confirms activation.

The Cinnabar Lab allows for cloning and genetic modification of pokemon.
It does this by mixing their DVs as of they were akin to genes and alleles.
This replicates the ability to do selective breeding for DVs in a way that's more realistic.

Lots of quick-key features.
- Quick 'Owned' Check - Place the cursor over FIGHT and press Select to play the enemy 'mon cry if it's already owned.
- Softlock Warp - Instantly teleport back to your mom's house if you get stuck.
- Running Shoes - Hold B to double your speed when walking, surfing, and biking. Includes proper animation speed-up!

- After the Elite-4, the game corner chief will buy pokemon from the player.
- There's a tournament being held in the SS Anne's kitchen after the Elite-4 are beaten. Yes, the ship returns!
- Added some special post-game trainer battles as fun little easter eggs. Can you find and defeat all five?

Changes to fishing!
- All rods have an expanded level range.
- The Old Rod has an expanded 'mon list.
- The Good Rod has an expanded 'mon list.
- The Route 12 Fishing Guru can be visited upon first reaching Lavender Town.
- The locations of the Good and Super Rod have been swapped.

Other minor changes to lessen annoyance.
- Low HP alarm only plays three times then turns itself off.
- TMs and HMs now have their move names (albeit abbreviated) appended to the item names.
- All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts.
- The safari zone mechanics run off level instead of speed, and safari balls have a boosted catch rate.
- Slot machines are a little more lucky, so now you can actually win big.
- CUT is not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub).
- Yellow version learnsets have been integrated, and stone evolutions gain back some level-up moves.
- Trapping moves play a 'poof' animation on the move's final turn in order to inform the player.
- A recalibrated daycare gives experience points scaled to your gym progress.
- The daycare lets you select moves to forget (if any) upon retreiving your pokemon.

Cheats and Secrets!

- And several others!


#Compatibility Notes
-----------

    - also does this when evolving via level-up for the new evolution's movelist
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - The function that applies badge stat-ups now selectively boosts the correct stat when called during a stat-up/down effect

  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
    - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
    - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective
  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd
  - New custom function for undoing the stat changes of burn and paralysis
    - undoing paralysis is accurate to within 0 to -3 points
    - undoing burn is accurate to within 0 to -1 point
  - PP-up uses are disregarded when determining to use STRUGGLE if one or more moves are disabled
  - AI will not do actions during Rage or when recharging
  - Fixed wrong crit damage for lvl > 127
  - Made adjustments to critical hit damage
    - Damage factor is now 2*(2*level)/5 + 4 instead of 2*(2*level)/5 + 2 to simplify some algebra
    - If non-crit damage would be >= crit damage, the regular modified stat values are applied instead
  - The player can now select a move even if frozen, and this fixes a PP underflow and link desync glitch
  - Accounted for underflow with switch-out messages
  - Safari Zone engine fixes:
    - The eating/angry message in safari battles will no longer display incorrectly when returning to neutral
	- The eating/angry safari state counter correctly increases by 1-5 turns instead of 0-4 turns
	- Safari battles correctly reset the catch rate when either eating/angry state returns to neutral


- Move fixes
  - Transform-related fixes:
      - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves)
      - Fixing Transformation loops
        - If Transform copies an opponent's Transform move,
        - And if the PP of that move is < 6,
          - It will copy that move's instantaneous PP less 1.
          - This limits the PP of using transform repeatedly between two pokemon
      - Enemy DVs can no longer be manipulated by having it use transform multiple times
	  - Fixed a conflict where transforming while disabled can leave the new moves disabled
	  - Fixed transformed 'mons reseting their moves when learning a level-up move
	  - Fixed a typo so now transformed 'mons retain their original palette
  - disable cannot critically hit nor print effectiveness message
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters
  - sleep now normal-chance hits a pkmn recharging from hyperbeam, but has no effect if it's already status-effected
  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Fixed Psywave underflow/overflow with levels of 0, 1, and above 170
  - Substitute-related fixes:
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
    - recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck (also fixes the sleep-trap glitch)
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage move fixes (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc):
    - can no longer critically hit
    - obey type immunities
	- ignore effectiveness text & sfx
	- use 2 bytes for damage instead of 1
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)
  - Non-link enemy mons now have PP, so always run checks for 0 PP during the disable effect
  - Fixed an issue with Disable's counter on slower 'mons and also corrected the statistical outcomes of the counter

  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup
  - AI scoring imposes a very heavy penalty for potentially switching in pokemon with less than 1/4 HP
  - AI switch scoring now penalizes bad match-ups between player and enemy 'mon types
  - AI switch scoring applies an extra penalty for possibly switching a pokemon into a super-effective move
  
- Trainer ai routine #3 added to the following trainer classes

- Trainer switching (ai routine #4)can now toggled ON and OFF
  - WHile OFF, trainers will not switch intelligently just like in the original retail games.
  - Press SELECT on the option menu to go to the extra menu and toggle this option under "AI SWAPS"
  - Note that Jugglers are unaffected because their official gimmick is that they switch randomly.

- Trainer stat DVs are now randomly generated to a degree (only in hard mode) to be above-average
- Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level (only in hard mode)
  - The stat experience total for a given level 'L' is SIGMA[n=6,L](12n+50)
  - No stat experience is given for level 5 and below.
  - Outside of hard mode, trainer pokemon have 0 stat experience per the vanilla games
- These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so it supports the new DVs and stat exp
- Special trainers, e4, and gym leaders are slightly adjusted in their item use
- Special trainers, e4, and gym leaders have slightly adjusted and buffed rosters for flavor and difficulty
- Many trainers have recieved slight roster adjustments so that almost all pokemon can be registered as seen
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn

  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch
- Adjustements to how trainers use healing items
  - Lance now has 2 hyper potions per pokemon like the rest of the elite 4
  - The Rival battles from the SS Anne through Pokemon Tower use super potions

  - The Champion can use Full Heals in response to a status effect with a 25% chance
  - Trainers will not use non-healing items if they or the player are at low HP, making them more aggressive
  - All trainers that use any kind of potion now use it with a 50% chance if their HP is low enough
    - Gym Leaders and mid-game Rival: below 1/5th total
    - Elite-4 and Champion: below 1/3th total
  
- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats

  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings
  - Adjusted daycare to allow exp values over $500000
  - Allow up to 8 digits when displaying experience on the status screen
  - Pokemon can now learn more than 1 more per level
  - The 1.5x EXP boost function now has overflow protection

    - Helps prevent crashes and glitches when updating an older save file
    - You will be given the choice to warp to Pallet Town if the rom hack version does not match
  - The function that shows the dex entry for starter pokemon is now more robust
    - It now works for any pokemon (like if the starters are changed or randomized)

  - If available on the current map, it will notify you if it can be found by walking, surfing, or by super rod
  - The Cerulean Cave is an "unknown dungeon" so...
    - Nest icons will not display for this location
    - But the notification for the current map will still function

- Improved itemfinder function
  - If an item is detected, it will play 1 to 3 chimes depending on how close it is (more chimes means closer to the item).
  - Lines will point in the direction of the item and flash with the chimes.
  - If the player is right on top of the item, no lines will show and the chime till play four times.
  - If the SELECT button is held while selecting to USE the itemfinder, then the original itemfinder function is used.

- Changes to fishing
  - All rods have an expanded level range
  - Old rod can fish up two kinds of pokemon (depending on the current map constant value)
    - Magikarp or Goldeen
    - Magikarp or Poliwag 
  - When using the old rod, press and hold B within about 1 second to always hook a magikarp
  - Good rod can fish up three or four kinds of pokemon (depending on the current map constant value)
    - Poliwag, Horsea, Krabby
    - Poliwag, Krabby, Goldeen, Psyduck
    - Goldeen, Psyduck, Shellder
    - Goldeen, Shellder, Horsea, Tentacool
  - The Route 12 Fishing Guru is now visitable upon first reaching Lavender Town
  - Swapped location of Good and Super Rod

- Changes to the daycare
  - The daycare lets you select moves to forget (if any) upon retreiving your pokemon
  - Retrieving a daycare pokemon that could have evolved via level will trigger evolution and learn any missed-out moves
  - The daycare will support two evolutions back-to-back
  - The daycare experience gain has been recalibrated
    - It no longer gives 1 exp per step
    - Instead, it falsifies the act of farming wild encounters against a pokemon with a base exp value of 56
    - The falsified encounter starts at level 5, and it increases 5 more levels per badge obtained
    - With 8 badges, using the daycare is essentially a faster way of farming level 45 basic pokemon
    - The downside of not gaining statEXP in the daycare still remains as a tradeoff
  - Added a PC to the daycare
  - Daycare allows HM moves on entered pokemon

  - Snagged this off reddit, but original artist unknown (let me know if this is yours)
- The elite 4 now use the gym battle music rather than the standard trainer music
- The juggler rosters, especially in fuchsia gym, have been slightly altered for flavor
- Just for fun, the last juggler in the fuchsia gym is replaced with a cameo of Janine
  - Though at this point she's still just a cooltrainer and doesn't have a unique battle sprite
- The L: block doesn't disappear when level hits three digits
- Greatly increased the speed and performance of spin tiles

#Additions
-----------

#Difficulty and scalable trainers
- There is an option to scale trainer rosters to the level of your strongest roster pkmn
  - Talk to the right-side aide in Oak's lab to toggle on/off
  - Enemy pkmn will evolve by level if applicable
    - Pokemon that evolve below level 30 will evolve at 4/3x the original level 
    - Pokemon that evolve >= level 30 will evolve at 8/7x the original level 
  - Gym leaders and the E4 scale slightly higher than normal trainers
  - If trainer scaling is on, you do not need to beat the 1st route 22 rival solo to get oak's pokeballs
  - In hard mode, or against gym leaders, the scaling is based on the absolute highest level of your team
  - In normal difficulty against regular trainers, the scaling is based on a weighted average of your team's levels
- Playing on hard mode provides increased difficulty
  - Pressing RIGHT while the cursor is in the BATTLE STYLE box will toggle the feature on/off
  - Contrasting this, pressing LEFT will let you select a battle style without toggling difficulty
  - Enemy trainer pokemon are assigned level-appropriate stat exp
  - Enemy trainer pokemon have randomized DVs that are above-average
  - Boss trainers (giovanni, elite 4, gym leaders, later-game rival) cannot have DVs below 8
  - Wild pokemon DVs get 1 re-roll each if less than 4, biasing them upwards a little bit
  - Badge-granted stat boosts are disabled in trainer battles
  - X-stat items have double the effect like in more recent generations
  - Revive items cannot be used in battles
  - Mewtwo will prevent you from using a master ball on it and use AI to choose moves

  - Warning: The difficulty will be compounded if both trainer scaling and hard mode are active
  - Oak's pokeballs will be upgraded to great balls if you beat the route 22 rival in hard mode
- Added the Clause Brothers to Viridian City
  - They toggle enforcement of the item, sleep, and/or freeze clauses
  - The clauses apply to the player and AI equally
  - Sleep and freeze clauses work like they do in Pokemon Stadium
- Added a fourth brother for the Trapping Move Clause
  - A counter tracks if the player or the opponent use trapping moves like Wrap multiple times in a row 
  - The counter increments only if a trapping effect move is selected to be used and it does not miss
  - After the counter has incremented to 2, 
    - selecting a trapping effect move additional times will make the move to go 2nd in the round 
    - this is the same priority as the move Counter
  - The counter only gets reset by switching or using a move that does not have the trapping effect 
  - Reseting the counter will restore normal priority to trapping effect moves.
- Added a fifth Clause Brother for the hyper beam clause; hyper beam will recharge if it KOs the opponent
- Link battles in the Colosseum now synchronize battle clauses between both players
  - The item clause is not applicable because items are not usable in link battles by default
  - There is a clipboard in the Colosseum that is used to reset and re-select your battle clauses
  - Any active clauses between your opponent and yourself are applied to both players
  - A splash screen before battle will desplay the enforced clauses
- There is now an obedience level-cap that can be toggled in the extra options menu under "LVL CAP"
  - While active, the current maximum obedience level will display in the options menu
  - All pokemon, not just trades, will start to disobey if over the displayed level cap
  - The cap will change based on which badge you have
  - Not recommended for use with trainer scaling since you might gain too many levels too quickly
  - Best to turn this off in the post-game as it's really for the gym challenge and elite-4

  - A slot is cleared when its 'mon leaves the party (such as being put in the PC)
  - In the case of a 'mon with 4 regular field moves:

#Pre-E4 NPCs
- The girl in Oak's lab toggles a built-in randomizer for wild pokemon and your starters
  - Shuffles all pokemon that can be gained through walking, surfing, fishing, or from the game corner
  - If activated early enough, your starter pokemon options are shuffled as well
  - Randomizes using a saved seed value, so the shuffled order is always preserved between play sessions
  - A new random seed is generated upon each new game
  - There are three pokemon lists based on base-stat-total; A, B, and C tiers
  - Pokemon are only shuffled within their own list in order to maintain some modicum of balance
  - Scripted events are unaffected (gifts, in-game trades, static encounters, etc)
  - The game's five legendary pokemon are excluded from randomization
  - The AREA feature of the pokedex automatically adjusts to show the new pokemon locations
  - Talking to the girl in Oak's lab allows the player to generate a new randomization seed value.  
  - The girl will also ask if full randomization is preferred, which will combine the tiers into one big list.  
- There is an Aide NPC in the viridian pokemon center that can toggle regular trainer randomization
  - Only affects regular trainers that use one level for all 'mons and have no custom movesets
  - Will replace their roster 'mons with random non-evolved 'mons (legendaries are excluded)
  - The new mons will be swapped with their evolved forms if at a high enough level
    - Pokemon that evolve below level 30 will evolve at 4/3x the original level 
    - Pokemon that evolve >= level 30 will evolve at 8/7x the original level   
  - This feature was added with the intent of spicing-up subsequent Gen-1 playthroughs
- New NPC in celadon hotel will reward coins for showing him requested pkmn
- Move deleter/relearner added to the saffron house below COPYCAT's house
  - Code comes from Mateo's Red++ hack. It's simply the best gen-1 implementation and I cannot come up with something better.
  - Talk to the little girl to delete moves.
  - Talk to her tutor to relearn moves.
  - I have expanded Mateo's code so that it also detects default level-0 moves from the baseStats header files.
- Catch-Up EXP Booster
  - Talk to the aide in the Celadon Diner to toggle this feature.  
  - While active, EXP gained is boosted if the active pokemon's level is lower than that of the fainted enemy.  
  - The boost is 1.5x multiplied by an additional 1.5x for every 3 levels of difference.  
  - For example, a level gap of 12 results in an EXP multiplier of (1.5)^4 = 5.0625.  
  - Use this feature to help you train-up new team members in the mid-to-late game.  
- Can rematch gym leaders and most non gym-leader trainers just by talking to them one or two times
  - Giovanni respawns after leaving the gym so you can rematch him
- Paras is gifted in the Route 2 house in case the player has no pokemon that can learn Cut
- Unused beedrill trade has been restored and placed on Route 22
- Added a scientist and books to the Cinnabar Lab fossil room for cloning and gene splicing
  - This process clones your 1st spot pokemon and modifies it with DNA from your 2nd spot pokemon.  
  - It does this by treating a pokemon's two bytes of DV values as if they were two genes with two alleles each.  
    - Gene-A has the Attack DV as its hi-side allele and the Defense DV as its lo-side allele.  
    - Gene-B has the Speed DV as its hi-side allele and the Special DV as its lo-side allele.  
    - The A-genes from the two donor pokemon will be mixed to make the clone's A-gene.  
    - The B-genes from the two donor pokemon will be mixed to make the clone's B-gene.  
  - Mixing two genes is done via Punnett Squares, and a random result is chosen based on its ratios.  
  - Within a Punnett quadrant, a hi allele makes the upper digits and a lo allele makes the lower digits.  
  - If two hi allels or two lo alleles fall within a Punnet quadrant, their order is randomly selected.  
- A new drink stand on the route 19 beach sells vending machine drinks

  - Repel effects will not block shiny encounters
- Shiny Mercy 
  - When a player encounters an AI trainer shiny pokemon, the next wild encounter will be shiny

  - The timing is different. You have to hold Down+B before the "[PLAYER] used [ITEM]" text finishes printing.
  - If successful, the ball tossed will be twice as effective as normal

- Added "The Shimmer", a cheat feature for those who want viability when using certain low-regarded pokemon.
  - Toggled ON/OFF via the glass pokeball decoration in the rival's house.
  - Pokemon Eligible: EKANS, CATERPIE, METAPOD, WEEDLE, KAKUNA, ZUBAT, PSYDUCK, PARAS, PONYTA, RATTATA, SANDSHREW, HORSEA, GOLDEEN, VENONAT, JIGGLYPUFF, ARBOK, BEEDRILL, BUTTERFREE, DITTO, FARFETCHD, GOLBAT, GOLDUCK, HITMONCHAN, LICKITUNG, ONIX, PARASECT, PINSIR, PORYGON, RAPIDASH, RATICATE, SANDSLASH, SEADRA, SEAKING, VENOMOTH, WIGGLYTUFF

  - The shimmer only manifests in 'mons that are fully evolved, even if their pre-evos gained the secret shimmer factor.
  - When the shimmer manifests as a 'mon gets sent out, that 'mon gets a large boost to some stats that are low-to-poor.
- Technical details of the shimmer
  - A 'mon eligible for shimmer that is sent out, either by player or enemy trainer, can get the shimmer factor.
  - The chance of getting the shimmer factor is 1-in-256 per send-out, rewarding a player that uses the 'mon frequently.
  - The odds increase by +(1-in-256) per 2048 HP-StatExp that the sent-out pokemon has, encouraging player investment.
  - The shimmer factor is defined via the pokemon's catch rate byte and is a value of $6D (held Miracle Berry in Gen-2).
  - The manifestation of the shimmer boosts one-to-four of a 'mons unmodified stats.
	- If 3/8ths of an unmodified stat is less than the mon's level, then the level value is added to that stat.
    - Stats that can be boosted are: attack, defense, speed, or special.
	- Exclusively for Hitmonchan, the shimmer adds the level twice to its special stat so it can use its elemental punches.
  - There is the same chance of shimmer manifesting on applicable enemy trainer pokemon.
  - Given their rosters, the shimmer will always manifest on the applicable pokemon of Bruno, Agatha, and the Karate Master.

#Built-In Nuzlocke Mode
------------------------
- Activation/Deactivation
  - Go to the OPTIONS screen and press SELECT to get to the extra menu.
  - Toggle this mode under "NUZLOCKE".
  
- This mode **DOES NOT** check if you have obtained pokeballs yet. It is in full effect when toggled to ON.  
  
- Rule 1: A pokemon that faints is considered dead and can no longer be used.
  - Revival items cannot be used in battle.
  - If a battle ends with no forfeiture, all pokemon with 0 HP are marked dead.
  - If a battle ends in a forfeit, all pokemon with 0 HP before the forfeit are marked dead.
  - Pokemon marked as dead have $05 written to their catch rate to permanently mark them.
  - Even if they are traded back and forth, dead pokemon remain marked as dead while in nuzlocke mode.
  - Medicinal items will not work on pokemon marked as dead, nor will Soft-boiled.
  - Party healing (Mom, Pokemon Center, blacking out, etc) makes a dead pokemon effectively useless.
  - To clarify, it gives a dead pokemon 1 HP, the FRZ status, and 0 PP for all moves.
  - This allows a player to continue the game with boxed pokemon in case of a total party loss.
  - Dead pokemon transferred to Gen-2 games will be holding a pokeball.

- Rule 2: You can only catch the 1st wild pokemon that you encounter in an area.
  - An "area" is defined by the name displayed on the town map.
  - You will be unable to throw balls in subsequent wild battles in that area.
  - Static wild battles count for this as well.
  - Wild battles before you can get pokeballs also count.
  - In light of this, you may want to delay activating nuzlocke mode until pokeballs are available.
  - Story wild battles (Old Man tutorial, Ghost Marowak, and Tower Ghosts) do not apply.
  
- Rule 3 (Optional): Nickname every pokemon you obtain.
  - You will always go straight to the nickname screen without a Yes/No prompt.
  - You can still opt out of a nickname by leaving the entry field blank.
  
- Built-in exceptions:
  - Shiny Clause: Nothing prevents you from throwing balls to catch a wild shiny pokemon.
  - Duplication Clause: Encountering a wild "owned" pokemon will not activate Rule 2.
  - Rule 2 resets for the Safari Zone area upon paying the entrance fee.
  - Catching a pokemon, even if owned, always activates Rule 2. Important for the Safari Zone and New Game+.
  - Dead pokemon can still use overworld moves (HM moves, Teleport, etc).

- Visuale Aides:
  - An Up-Down-Arrow symbol will display on the HUD of a wild pokemon if a ball is allowed to be tossed.
  - This symbol follows Rule 2 and any built-in exceptions previously destribed.

- Nuzlocke and the Safari Zone:
  - The Safari Zone is not inherently limited to a single entry in nuzlocke mode.
  - Entering the Safari Zone gives the player an opportunity to catch 1 pokemon.
  - And this opportunity presents itself each time the player pays the entry fee.

- Nuzlocke and New Game+:
  - New Game+ preserves the pokedex.
  - This means the Duplication Clause will prevent Rule 2 from activating.
  - In light of this, Rule 2 will always activate on an area upon the first catch made there.
  
- Dead pokemon and toggling Nuzlocke mode:
  - It is possible to cheat by turning off nuzlocke mode, healing a dead pokemon, then turning it back on.
  - If this is done, the healed pokemon is still considered dead.
  - This means that party-wide healing will make it useless and medicine still has no effect.
  - This has the potential for a kind of "undead run" rule variant.
 
- Removing the death marker:
  - The only way to undo this is by modifying the dead pokemon's catch rate.
  - This is usually done via the Gen-2 time capsule and trading it back without a hold item or a different hold item.


#About Gameshark Codes
----------------------
Will they work? Largely, yes...with some rules.  
Shin Pokemon does not reassign any wram or hram addresses, so cheat codes that modify values within these address ranges will still work.  
The GB/C's wram is in addresses C000-DFFF, and hram is in FF80-FFFE.  

Gameshark codes for the GB/C have an 8-digit hexadecimal format in the form of LMNOYZWX. The meaning of the separate digits is:  
- LM - External RAM bank number (typically 01)
- NO - a 2-digit byte to act as your injected value
- WXYZ - A 2-byte Memory Address to write the new value to (Note that the gameshark code format reverses the low and high bytes of the address)

So say you want a cheat code that gives you 99 of the first item in the bag.  
The quantity of the first item in the bag is at address D31F in wram, and 99-decimal equals 63-hex.  
This gives a gameshark code of 01631FD3.  

Any codes that follow these conventions and only modify the wram or hram should work like they do in the vanilla games.  


#Will Not Implement / Out of Scope
-----------------------------------
These are things that are commonly requested but fall outside the scope of the project. There are no plans to implement these:  
- Yellow Version - This is a different rom base, and I have no intention at this time to start all over on numerous features.
- Gen 2 color / graphics - The goal is to keep art direction and assets within the purview of a pre-1998 direction.
- Battle mechanics from later generations - Gen 1's gameplay must be generally be preserved, so no special defense, physical-special split, critical hits untied from speed, updated move pools, etc.
- Later-gen evolutions/forms/variants - I'm keeping this strictly to the original 151.
- Translations - This is best handled by other teams using their own project repositories.


#Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------
> **I'm getting an Emulator Error message at the main title menu. What does this mean?**

There are a couple checks performed in the background under the assumption that some form of emulation is being used. One or more messages may be displayed to indicate failures of these checks. For example, emulators like Visual Boy Advance and Goomba allow data read/writes to VRAM during mode 3 wherein the LCD controller is utilizing it; this is not possible on a real Game Boy and may cause issues with Shin Pokemon. Another example, one where Visual Boy Advance-M fails, is in the cpu cycles required to initiate an OAM Interrupt after the LCD goes from being disabled to enabled.

These messages are informative in nature and do not impede play. That said, it is encouraged to switch to a more accurate emulator to avoid things like graphical glitches and other weirdness. See "Compatibility Notes" for more info.

> **Will you do a special request just for me or make some specific patches or a ROM file for me?**

No. Such requests will be politely declined. If you think you have a good recommendation, please fill out a suggestion ticket in the Issues tab of this project's github repository.

> **I love your work! How can I donate to you?**

The gesture is appreciated and highly flattering, but donations of any sort are politely declined.
	
> **What are the best ways to support Shin Pokemon?**

There are several ways you can support the project:
- Stream your playthrough.
- Make a Let's Play series.
- Do a review or an analysis piece.
- Create highly detailed bug reports with an "Issues" ticket.
- Recording and uploading your gameplay is the best resource for troubleshooting. Let's Plays and stream VODs are routinely searched for and examined. 

> **How do you come up with with new features and their implementations?**

It's primarily based on nostalgic schoolyard rumors, interesting "what if" ideas, and love for secrets and easter eggs from the 1990s gaming era.

> **A separate project used code from Shin Pokemon to do such-and-such feature. Will you backport it into Shin Pokemon?**

Let such projects have their own identity. Other creators need to be able to show off and be proud of what they made.

> **Why did you not use the artwork of Trainer Green from the Adventures comic or the Let's Go games for the female trainer option?**

Internal debate was heated on how to proceed for a female player option, but here's the reasoning that won out:
- Green's design was never intended to be a playable character. Ken Sugimori created her back-view because he needed to depict a trainer trio for an art piece.
- Trainer Red was always supposed to be the player. An original female trainer was never considered until gen-2's development phase around Nov-Dec 1997.
- Others already created original sprite art to include in their own projects, and lifting it might step on their toes or foster ill feelings.

So it was decided to whip-up something simple and original that depicted a female version of Trainer Red. She also acts as a (private) dev shoutout.

> **Why can Bide still hit opponents in the Fly/Dig state when Pokemon Stadium fixes this?**

Bide is a crummy move, but it gains a little more strategy in Shin Pokemon. This oversight was purposefully retained as a "feature" to help it out some more.

> **Why does Hyper Beam recharge work like it does in gen-2 instead of always needing to recharge like in Stadium?**

Shin Pokemon did do always-recharge at one point, but it was hated by *literally every player*. Removing recharge on a miss was done as a compromise.

> **Why is there a brief white frame flash when the screen transitions on Gameboy or Gameboy Color?**

It's a hardware quirk. There is a brief moment where the LCD is disabled. When it is re-enabled, the screen displays blank white for 1 frame. The LCD gets disabled because it allows writing to VRAM at any time.  
EDIT: I believe I've found a workaround by writing to VRAM during the HBLANK and VBLANK periods. The timing is a little tricky.
